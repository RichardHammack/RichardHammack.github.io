        <b>Prerequisite:</b> MATH 201<br>
            <B>Text:</B> <em>Book of Proof</em>, By Richard Hammack
        <P>This class is an introduction to methods of reasoning used in advanced mathematics. It will probably be a turning point in your mathematical education. In your prior mathematics courses you were primarily concerned with  finding solutions to computational problems.  MATH 300 is more theoretical. It is concerned with the methods of verifying (proving) whether  mathematical statements are true or false. This demands lots of thought, work and writing from you. <br>
          <br>
          You are expected to keep up with the reading. There are frequent written assignments, two tests, and a final exam. Your grade is determined 
          by scores on assignments, exams and participation. Details 
          follow.
	    <dl>
		      <B>Assignments:</B> Written assignments are collected, graded and returned.
		      <dd><ul>
		   <li>Papers are collected at the beginning of class on appointed days.</li>
          <li>Papers submitted after the beginning of class may not be graded.</li>
          <li>If you must miss class when an assignment is due, please give  it to me early or have  a classmate turn it in for you.</li>
          <li>You may email an assignment to me, but it must arrive in my inbox no later than the beginning of class on the day it is due. I sometimes don't print emailed assignments, so you may not get any written feedback from me.</li>
          <li>Exceptionally sloppy work is not graded.</li>
          <li>I expect compete sentences (when appropriate) and good English usage. Points may be deducted for bad style. </li>
          <li>I encourage you to work together, though the work you turn 
            in must be your own.</li>
          <li>Resist the temptation to hunt for solutions on line. </li>
          <li> In addition to the work you hand in, you should work <em>lots</em> of extra 
  problems for practice. </li>
          <li><strong><em>Some assigned problems are intended to make you think about ideas not discussed 
            in class</em></strong>. </li>
</ul>
		      </dd></dl>
	

        <strong>Tests:</strong> There are two  tests, scheduled for  March 6 and April 10. Use of calculators is not allowed during tests. In writing the tests, I assume that you have been studying the material <EM><strong>at least 6 hours per week outside 
          of class. </strong></EM><br>
          <br>
          
          <b>Participation:</b> Participation means that you in some way demonstrate intellectual 
          involvement in the course. It does not necessarily mean that you ask 
          questions and volunteer answers. Active participation may include your working 
          lots of exercises, taking advantage of office hours, and displaying preparedness, 
          dedication and intellectual curiosity. Things that could cause you to lose participation points include sleeping in class, leaving your cell phone on, texting in class, missing too much class, and rude behavior. (Not that I expect you would do any of these things!)
          <br>
          <br>
              <b>Final Exam:</b> The final exam is comprehensive, covering all material discussed in class. It is closed-book and closed-notes. It is scheduled for 1:00&ndash;3:50 PM on Thursday May 3.
          </center>   
        In writing the final exam, I will assume that you have been studying the material <EM><strong>at least 6 hours per week outside 
      of class, throughout the entire semester. </strong></EM>

      <td width="95%"><P><B>Attendance: </B>I do not take attendance, but I do notice if you are not 
          attending class. If your grades are high, I do not mind if you miss class occasionally; otherwise, excessive absences may result in a reduced participation score.
        
        <P> As a
        matter of courtesy, you should arrive punctually and stay for the entire 
          duration of each class you attend. Please inform me ahead of time if you must 
          leave early.
        <P><B><br>
        Make-up Work:</B> Under normal circumstances I do not make a distinction between excused and unexcused absences. An absence of any type can impact your performance. I do not give makeup tests, nor do I accept late homework. I will drop your lowest test grade and several low homework grades. 
        If you miss 
        one test, then that counts as the dropped grade. If you miss the final exam for a legitimate reason (i.e. a documented illness or emergency) then I can give you a grade of Incomplete (I) for the course, and you will need to make up the missed exam.

            <br>
        Internet:</b>  Information about this course is posted on my web page (not on Blackboard). Go to <tt>www.people.vcu.edu/~rhammack</tt> and click on &quot;Spring 2012 Schedule,&quot; then &quot;Math 300.&quot;  There you will find the syllabus, assignments, copies of old tests, and other materials. Solutions for all graded work (assignments and tests) will be posted after the due dates.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Email:</b>
 Any email correspondence concerning this course should be through your official VCU email address. University policy prevents me from discussing many aspects of the course through other email addresses. I may send email messages either to the whole class or individuals in the class. It is your responsibility to check your VCU email regularly. 
        <p><b>Cell Phones:</b> Please be sure that all cell phones and other electronic 
          devices (including iPods, BlackBerries and laptops) are turned<b> off </b>and <strong>stowed away</strong> for the <b>entire duration</b> of each class.
        Leaving such devices on may lower your participation score. 
        <P align="left"> <B>Office:</B> Please feel free to stop by my office whenever you have a question, 
          or if you just want to chat. If my posted hours are inconvenient, I will be 
          happy to schedule an appointment. 
        Tell me if you are having trouble. Catching up can be very difficult once 
          you get behind, so let me know as soon as you think there is a problem. 
          <br>  
          <br>
          <strong>Exercises:</strong> For each section we cover, you should work as many of the exercises as possible for practice. Answers or hints are provided for many odd-numbered exercises. Some of these problems will be used for the tests and final exam.
        
        Keep in mind that there can be many correct approaches for some proof-oriented questions, so the fact that your answer does not match mine does not necessarily mean it is wrong. Ask me if you are ever unsure about the validity of your solution.
