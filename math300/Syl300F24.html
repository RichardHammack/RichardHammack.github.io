It will probably be a turning point in your              mathematical education. In your prior mathematics courses you were              primarily concerned with finding solutions to computational              problems. MATH 300 is more theoretical. It is concerned with the              methods of verifying (proving) whether mathematical statements are              true or false. This demands lots of thought, work and writing from              you. <br>              <br>              You are expected to keep up with the reading. There are frequent              quizzes, two tests, and a final exam. Details follow. </p>            <dl>            </dl>            <strong>Tests:</strong> There are two tests, as noted on the course            calendar. Use of calculators is not allowed during tests. In writing            the tests, I assume that you have been studying the material <em><strong>at
                least 6 hours per week outside of class. </strong></em><br>            <br>            <b>Participation:</b> Participation means that you in some way            demonstrate intellectual involvement in the course. It does not            necessarily mean that you ask questions and volunteer answers.            Active participation may include your working lots of exercises,            taking advantage of office hours, and displaying preparedness,            dedication and intellectual curiosity. Things that could cause you            to lose participation points include sleeping in class, using a cell            phone in class, missing too much class, and rude behavior. (Not that            I expect you would do any of these things!) <br>            <br>            <b>Final Exam:</b> The final exam is comprehensive, covering all            material discussed in class. It is closed-book and closed-notes. It            is scheduled for 12:30-3:20 PM on Thursday December 12. In writing            the final exam, I will assume that you have been studying the            material <em><strong>at least 6 hours per week outside of class,                throughout the entire semester. </strong></em> <br>            <br>            <table cellpadding="3" border="0" width="100%">              <tbody>                <tr valign="top">                  <td><b>Grading:</b> </td>                  <td align="RIGHT">                    <div align="center"><strong>The 10-point grading scale is                        used:</strong> <br>                      <br>                      <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0" width="35%">                        <tbody>                          <tr>                            <td align="LEFT">A:</td>                            <td align="RIGHT"> 90<i>-</i>100</td>                          </tr>                          <tr>                            <td align="LEFT">B:</td>                            <td align="RIGHT">80<i>-</i>89</td>                          </tr>                          <tr>                            <td align="LEFT">C:</td>                            <td align="RIGHT">70<i>-</i>79</td>                          </tr>                          <tr>                            <td align="LEFT">D:</td>                            <td align="RIGHT">60<i>-</i>69</td>                          </tr>                          <tr>                            <td align="LEFT">F:</td>                            <td align="RIGHT">0<i>-</i>59</td>                          </tr>                        </tbody>                      </table>                      <br>                    </div>                  </td>                  <td align="RIGHT">                    <div align="center"><strong>Your final average will be                        computed as follows:</strong> <br>                      <br>                      <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0" width="50%">                        <tbody>                          <tr>                            <td align="LEFT" width="76%">Quizzes:</td>                            <td align="RIGHT" width="24%">32%</td>                          </tr>                          <tr>                            <td align="LEFT">Highest Test Grade: </td>                            <td align="RIGHT">32%</td>                          </tr>                          <tr>                            <td align="LEFT">Participation:</td>                            <td align="RIGHT">4%</td>                          </tr>                          <tr>                            <td align="LEFT">Final Exam:</td>                            <td align="RIGHT">32%</td>                          </tr>                          <tr>                            <td colspan="2" align="LEFT">                              <hr></td>                          </tr>                          <tr>                            <td align="LEFT">Total: </td>                            <td align="RIGHT">100%</td>                          </tr>                        </tbody>                      </table>                    </div>                  </td>                </tr>              </tbody>            </table>            <strong><br>            </strong></td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>    <br>    <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0" width="100%">      <tbody>        <tr>          <td width="5%">&nbsp;</td>          <td width="95%">            <p><b>Attendance: </b>I do not take attendance, but I do notice if              you are not attending class.

I will drop your lowest test grade              and several low quiz grades. If you miss one test, then that              counts as the dropped grade. If you miss the final exam for a              legitimate reason (i.e. a documented illness or emergency) then I              can give you a grade of Incomplete (I) for the course, and you              will need to make up the missed exam. </p>            <p><b>Internet:</b> Information about this course is posted on my              web page (not on Canvas).

University              policy prevents me from discussing many aspects of the course              through other email addresses. I may send email messages either to              the whole class or individuals in the class.

Tell me if you are having trouble. Catching up can              be very difficult once you get behind, so let me know as soon as              you think there is a problem. <br>              <br>              <strong>Exercises:</strong> For each section we cover, you should              work as many of the exercises as possible for practice.

Keep in mind              that there can be many correct approaches for some proof-oriented              questions, so the fact that your answer does not match mine does              not necessarily mean it is wrong.
