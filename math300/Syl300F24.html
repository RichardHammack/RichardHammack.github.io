There are frequent              quizzes, two tests, and a final exam. Details follow. <br>              <strong><br>                Exercises:</strong> There is an <a href="ExerciseList.html">Exercise                List</a> of odd-numbered exercises from the text. (Odd numbered              exercises have answers or solutions in the back of the text.) You              should work these for practice. Quiz and tests questions will be              similar to (sometimes identical to) problems on the Exercise List.              Keep in mind that there can be many correct approaches for some              proof-oriented questions, so the fact that your answer does not              match the book's does not necessarily mean it is wrong. Ask me if              you are ever unsure about the validity of your solution. </p>            <p><b>Quizzes:</b> There will be a short quiz during nearly every              class meeting. Quizzes are closed-book and closed-notes. No              calculators, etc. All you will need is something to write with              (and to have studied).</p>            <dl>            </dl>            <strong>Tests:</strong> There are two closed-book tests, as noted on            the course calendar. Use of calculators is not allowed during tests.            In writing the tests, I assume that you have been studying the            material <em><strong>at least 6 hours per week outside of class. </strong></em><br>            <br>            <b>Final Exam:</b> The final exam is comprehensive, covering all            material discussed in class. It is closed-book and closed-notes. It            is scheduled for 12:30-3:20 PM on Thursday December 12. In writing            the final exam, I will assume that you have been studying the            material <em><strong>at least 6 hours per week outside of class,                throughout the entire semester. <br>              </strong></em> <br>            <b>Participation:</b> Participation means that you in some way            demonstrate intellectual involvement in the course. It does not            necessarily mean that you ask questions and volunteer answers.            Active participation may include your working lots of exercises,            taking advantage of office hours, and displaying preparedness,            dedication and intellectual curiosity. Things that could cause you            to lose participation points include sleeping in class, using a cell            phone in class, missing too much class, and rude behavior. (Not that            I expect you would do any of these things!) <em><strong></strong></em>            <br>            <br>            <table cellpadding="3" border="0" width="100%">              <tbody>                <tr valign="top">                  <td><b>Grading:</b> </td>                  <td align="RIGHT">                    <div align="center"><strong>The 10-point grading scale is                        used:</strong> <br>                      <br>                      <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0" width="35%">                        <tbody>                          <tr>                            <td align="LEFT">A:</td>                            <td align="RIGHT"> 90<i>-</i>100</td>                          </tr>                          <tr>                            <td align="LEFT">B:</td>                            <td align="RIGHT">80<i>-</i>89</td>                          </tr>                          <tr>                            <td align="LEFT">C:</td>                            <td align="RIGHT">70<i>-</i>79</td>                          </tr>                          <tr>                            <td align="LEFT">D:</td>                            <td align="RIGHT">60<i>-</i>69</td>                          </tr>                          <tr>                            <td align="LEFT">F:</td>                            <td align="RIGHT">0<i>-</i>59</td>                          </tr>                        </tbody>                      </table>                      <br>                    </div>                  </td>                  <td align="RIGHT">                    <div align="center"><strong>Your final average will be                        computed as follows:</strong> <br>                      <br>                      <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0" width="50%">                        <tbody>                          <tr>                            <td align="LEFT" width="76%">Quizzes:</td>                            <td align="RIGHT" width="24%">32%</td>                          </tr>                          <tr>                            <td align="LEFT">Highest Test Grade: </td>                            <td align="RIGHT">32%</td>                          </tr>                          <tr>                            <td align="LEFT">Participation:</td>                            <td align="RIGHT">4%</td>                          </tr>                          <tr>                            <td align="LEFT">Final Exam:</td>                            <td align="RIGHT">32%</td>                          </tr>                          <tr>                            <td colspan="2" align="LEFT">                              <hr></td>                          </tr>                          <tr>                            <td align="LEFT">Total: </td>                            <td align="RIGHT">100%</td>                          </tr>                        </tbody>                      </table>                    </div>                  </td>                </tr>              </tbody>            </table>            <strong><br>            </strong></td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>    <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0" width="100%">      <tbody>        <tr>          <td width="5%">&nbsp;</td>          <td width="95%">            <p><b>Attendance: </b>I do not take attendance, but I do notice if              you are not attending class.

If you miss the final exam for a              legitimate reason (i.e. a documented illness or emergency) then I              can give you a grade of Incomplete (I) for the course, and you              will need to make up the missed exam. </p>            <p><b>Internet:</b> Information about this course is posted on my              web page (not on Canvas).
