    <br />
  It is inspired by a photograph by the American photographer Walker Evans (1903&#8211;1975). Taken in Birmingham Alabama in 1936, Evan's photograph shows a portion of a storefront window of a portrait photographer's studio. The composition is starkly mathematical. Five-by-three groups of portraits are arranged in a larger three-by-five array. It took the genius of Evans to see such depth and humanity in a simple grid.</span></span></span></span></p>
  <p class="style1">In my adaptation, portraits of mathematicians from throughout history are arranged behind the word PROOF. It is intended as a reminder that a proof is an eminently human construction. A proof is a rhetorical device that compels us to believe a mathematical truth. Although mathematical reality exists beyond and independent of our experience, a proof is a thing of our own making. Creating a good proof can take creativity, insight, ingenuity, brilliance and good taste.</p>
  <p class="style1">Though not all of these traits may be necessary for every proof you write in this course, the things you learn here may nonetheless lead you to a higher plane of understanding and creativity.</p>
