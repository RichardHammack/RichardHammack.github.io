                <br>
                In MATH 200 and MATH 201 you learned the fundamentals of differentiation and integration of functions such as <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>), involving one variable. MATH 307 extends these ideas to functions involving more than one variable, such as <em>f(x,y)</em> and <em>f(x,y,z)</em>, etc. This greatly widens the scope and power of calculus, because most practical problems to which calculus applies involve many variables. We begin with Chapters 12 and 13, which cover the basics of vectors and vector-valued functions in two- and three-dimensional space. Chapter 14 treats differentiation of such functions, and this naturally involves generalizing the concepts of limits and continuity. Finally, Chapters 15 and 16 develop the theory of integration of functions of several variables.<br>
                <br>
                This class covers a lot of material and will move quickly. It will probably require much work of you consistently throughout the semester. To do well you will need to read the text carefully and actively, attend class regularly, and work lots of practice problems (not just those assigned for homework). I maintain a <a href="Exercises.html">list of suggested exercises</a> on the <a href="index.html">course web page</a>. You will probably find that you need to study at least eight hours per week, every week of the semester in order to do well. <br>

If you took either MATH 200 or MATH 201 at VCU, you probably already have access to the above materials. Otherwise you  have	three	options	for purchasing them. You may do any one of the following.
<ol>
<li><strong>Hard Copy of Text with MyMathLab and e-text:<br>
</strong>Go to the VCU Bookstore and purchase <em>Thomas' Calculus: Early Transcendental</em>, 12th edition, with MyMathLab Access (ISBN 9780321648426) for $237 (or $178, used). The inside cover of this book contains a package with an access code that allows you to register for a MyMathLab account with access to our course. </li>
<li><strong>MyMathLab and e-text:</strong> <br>
  Go to the VCU Bookstore and purchase the <em>MyMathLab Student Access Kit</em> (ISBN 9780321199911) for $111.45 (or $83.60 used). This kit includes an access code that allows you to register for your MyMathLab account with access to our course. The MyMathLab account has a link to an electronic version of the text, <em>Thomas' Calculus: Early Transcendental</em>, 12th edition.</li>
<li><strong>MyMathLab and e-text:</strong> <br>
  You can purchase an access code directly from MyMathLab. Follow the instructions on the <a href="MmlRegistrationS14.pdf">MyMathLab handout</a>.  </li>

            <td width="96%">Your course grade will be determined by your performance on the following:<ul>
                <li><B>Homework assignments: </B>Assignments are made through MyMathLab and in class. Typically you  have the option of either doing an assignment on MyMathLab or submitting it hand-written. Several assignments will be hand-written only (i.e. not on MyMathLab). All will be announced both in class and on line. For the MyMathLab questions you will get as many tries as needed on each question (except for some multiple choice questions), but you must eventually arrive at a correct answer to get credit. 
                You do not have the option of redoing the written homework for additional points. There will typically be one or two  homework sets per week. <strong>Some homework exercises are intended to make you think about ideas not discussed in class</strong>.
                <li><strong>Tests: </strong>There are  three closed book tests at times to be announced.      <strong>Calculators and computers are not used on any in-class test</strong>.                
              Tests are written under the  assumption that you are studying the material <EM><strong>at least 8 hours per week outside 
                      of class. </strong></EM>
                <li>                  <b>Engagement:</b> Engagement means that you in some way demonstrate intellectual 
                  involvement in the course. It does not necessarily mean that you ask 
                  questions and volunteer answers. Active engagement may include your working 
                  lots of exercises, taking advantage of office hours, and displaying preparedness, 
                  dedication and intellectual curiosity. Things that could diminish engagement points include sleeping in class, excessive absence, leaving a cell phone on, texting in class,  and other rude behaviors. (Not that I expect you would do any of these things!)
                <li><b>Final Exam:</b> The final exam is cumulative, covering all material discussed in class. All you will need to bring to the finial exam is something to write with. Books, notes, calculators, computers, etc., are not allowed on the final.  The final exam is scheduled for Tuesday May 6, from 8:00 am until 10:50 am.
                </center>
                The exam is written under the
              assumption that you have been studying the material <EM><strong>at least 8 hours per week outside 
                      of class throughout the semester. </strong></EM>

                <li><strong>Devices: </strong>You are expected to be connected with the course and course material. All devices not related to coursework (iPods, laptops, etc.) are to be turned off and put away for the entire duration of class.

Please be sure that your travel plans do not conflict with the exam schedule. 
                If you miss the final exam due to a documented illness or emergency, then I can give you a grade of incomplete (I) and you will have to make up the final by the deadline set by the University.

              You can collaborate on homework, but <strong>not</strong> on tests and exams. Any instance of cheating is considered an honor offence and is dealt with according to University policy.
                <li>In addition to the required MyMathLab homework assignments, you are expected to work <strong>lots</strong> of extra problems for practice.  Please see the <a href="Exercises.html">Exercise List</a> on the course web page.
