            <p><b> Required Text: </b><i>Introduction to Graph Theory</i>
              (Second Edition) by Douglas B. West<br>
              (ISBN 0-13-014400-2)<br>
              <br>
              This is a second course in graph theory, building on the material
              of MATH 556. Topics include material from Chapters 5 (coloring), 6
              (planarity) and 7 (edges and cycles). Topics in the later part of
              the semester will be selected from Chapter 8 and determined by
              student interest.</p>
            Your grade is determined by two tests, weekly quizzes and a final exam. 
               <em><strong></strong></em><br>
            <br>
            <b>Homework:</b> I will maintain a list of suggested problems for homework. Although homework will not be collected, quiz questions will be taken from the suggested homework problems. 
              <br />
              <br />
              <b>Quizzes:</b> Typically there will be one quiz per week (except there is no quiz on test weeks). Quiz dates will be posted on the calendar. Each quiz will consist of one or more problems from the homework list. Quizzes are closed book and closed notes.
              
              <br />
              <br />
              
            <b>Tests:</b> Tests are closed-book and closed-notes, and no
            computing technology of any type is allowed. The dates will be
            determined at least several weeks in advance and posted on the
            course calendar. On the calendar you will also find links to blank and solved versions of tests from previous semesters.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Final Exam:</b> The final exam is comprehensive. It is
            closed-book and closed-notes, and no computing technology of any
            type is allowed. It is scheduled for 12:30-3:20 on Thursday May
