            <p><b> Required Text: </b><i>Introduction to Graph Theory</i>
              (Second Edition) by Douglas B. West<br>
              (ISBN 0-13-014400-2)<br>
              <br>
              This is a second course in graph theory, building on the material
              of MATH 556. Topics may include digraphs and tournaments, planar
              graphs, line graphs, vertex- and edge-coloring, cycle structures,
              perfect graphs, matroids, spectral graph theory and
              NP-completeness. Topics in the later part of the semester my be
              decided by student interest.</p>
            Your grade is determined by two tests, homework and a final exam. <em><strong></strong></em><br>
            <br>
            <b>Homework:</b> Written homework assignments will be collected,
            graded and returned throughout the semester. Please adhere to the
            following guidelines. Take particular note of items 5 and 6
            concerning collaboration and resources. <strong></strong>
            <ol>
              <li>Papers are collected at the beginning of class on appointed
                days.</li>
              <li>If you must miss class when an assignment is due, please give
                it to me early or have a classmate turn it in for you.</li>
              <li>If you are unable submit your homework in class you may email
                it to me, but it must arrive in my inbox no later than the
                beginning of class on the day it is due.&nbsp; I sometimes don't
                print emailed assignments, so you may not get any written
                feedback from me. If the scan is of poor quality I will not be
                able to grade it. The file should be a single PDF document with
                correct orientation, pagination and scale. </li>
              <li>Exceptionally sloppy or disorganized work is not graded.</li>
              <li>I encourage you to work together, though the work you turn in
                must be your own.</li>
              <li>If you are really stuck I can give you a hint. You may also
                consult other printed textbooks or articles for ideas and
                additional background. However, <b>do not search the Internet
                  for solutions.</b> I do not grade work that I recognize as
                copied or paraphrased. Repeated offenses will be treated as
                honor violations.</li>
              <li> In addition to the work you hand in, you should work <em>lots</em>
                of extra problems for practice. Your best strategy is to work
                the problems that interest you the most. If an unassigned
                exercise become boring or tedious, then move on.</li>
              <li>In addition to regularly assigned exercises, I may
                occasionally suggest optional open-ended and more challenging
                exercises. Such problems can be turned in at any time during the
                semester. Correct solutions will garner extra credit. </li>
              <li><strong>Some assigned problems are intended to make you think
                  about ideas not discussed in class</strong>. </li>
            </ol>
            <ul>
            </ul>
            <b> Tests:</b> Both tests are closed-book and closed-notes, and no
            computing technology of any type is allowed. The dates will be
            determined at least several weeks in advance and posted on the
            course calendar.<em><strong></strong></em><br>
            <br>
            <b>Final Exam:</b> The final exam is comprehensive. It is
            closed-book and closed-notes, and no computing technology of any
            type is allowed. It is scheduled for 8:00–10:50 a.m. on Tuesday May
            7.<em><strong></strong></em> <br>
