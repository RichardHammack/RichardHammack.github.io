        <b>Prerequisite:</b> Calculus-level placement on the VCU Mathematics Placement Test within the one-year period immediately preceding enrollment in the course or MATH   151, MATH   200, MATH   201 or MGMT 212. <br>
        <br>
            <B>Text:</B> <em>Elements of Discrete Mathematics, </em> by Richard Hammack. This is a free on-line text in PDF format. Download it at the course web page: <TT><a href="index.html">www.people.vcu.edu/~rhammack/Math211</a></TT>
(You can also pick up an inexpensive comb-bound hard copy at Wythkin Printing, 911 W. Grace St., Richmond.)
<P>This class is an introduction to methods of <em>discrete</em> mathematical structures and systems. Topics include sets, counting, logic, algorithms, methods of proof, induction, relations and functions.<br>
        <br>
        You are expected to keep up with the reading. There are frequent written assignments, two tests, and a final exam. Your grade is determined 
        by scores on assignments, exams and participation. Details 
        follow.
	    <dl>
		      <B>Assignments:</B> Written assignments are collected, graded and returned.
		      <dd><ul>
		   <li>Papers are collected at the beginning of class on appointed days.</li>
          <li>Papers submitted after the beginning of class may not be graded.</li>
          <li>If you must miss class when an assignment is due, please give  it to me early or have  a classmate turn it in for you.</li>
          <li>You may email an assignment to me, but it must arrive in my inbox no later than the beginning of class on the day it is due. I sometimes don't print emailed assignments, so you may not get any written feedback from me.</li>
          <li>Exceptionally sloppy work is not graded.</li>
          <li>I expect compete sentences (when appropriate) and good English usage. Points may be deducted for bad style. </li>
          <li>I encourage you to work together, though the work you turn 
            in must be your own.</li>
          <li>Resist the temptation to hunt for solutions on line. I do not give credit to solutions that I recognize as copied.</li>
          <li> In addition to the work you hand in, you should work <em>lots</em> of extra 
  problems for practice. </li>
          <li><strong><em>Some assigned problems are intended to make you think about ideas not discussed 
            in class</em></strong>. </li>
</ul>
		      </dd></dl>
	

        <strong>Tests:</strong> There are two  tests (dates to be determined). In writing the tests, I assume that you have been studying the material <EM><strong>at least 6 hours per week outside 
          of class. </strong></EM><br>
          <br>
          
          <b>Participation/Engagement:</b> Participation means that you in some way demonstrate intellectual 
          involvement in the course. It does not necessarily mean that you ask 
          questions and volunteer answers. Active participation may include your working 
          lots of exercises, taking advantage of office hours, and displaying preparedness, 
          dedication and intellectual curiosity. Things that could cause you to lose participation points include sleeping in class, using your phone in class, texting in class, missing too much class, etc.<br>
          <br>
              <b>Final Exam:</b> The final exam is comprehensive, covering all material discussed in class. It is closed-book and closed-notes. Section 3 takes the exam 1:00&ndash;3:50 pm on Tuesday December 12; Section 1 takes it 8:00&ndash;10:50 am on Thursday December 14.
</center>   
        In writing the final exam, I will assume that you have been studying the material <EM><strong>at least 6 hours per week outside 
      of class, throughout the entire semester. </strong></EM>

        <P> You are responsible for all material covered in class. As a
        matter of courtesy, you should arrive punctually and stay for the entire

        Make-up Work:</B> If you miss a test for a documented illness or emergency, then I will consider scheduling a make-up for a later date, provided you notify me before the time of the missed test.  Otherwise, one missed test will count as a dropped grade. I will drop  several low homework grades. 
        If you miss a homework assignment, then that counts as a dropped grade (up to the number of homeworks dropped). If you miss the final exam for a legitimate reason (i.e. a documented illness or emergency) then I can give you a grade of Incomplete (I) for the course, and you will need to make up the missed exam.<b><br>
            <br>
        Internet:</b>  Information about this course is posted on my web page (not on Blackboard). Go to <tt>www.people.vcu.edu/~rhammack/Math211</tt>.   There you will find the syllabus, assignments, the course calendar, and other materials. Solutions for all graded work (assignments and tests) will be posted after the due dates.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Email:</b>
 Any email correspondence concerning this course should be through your official VCU email address. University policy prevents me from discussing many aspects of the course through other email addresses. I may send email messages either to the whole class or individuals in the class. It is your responsibility to check your VCU email regularly. 
        <p><b>Cell Phones:</b> Please be sure that all cell phones and other electronic 
          devices (including  laptops) are muted<b> </b>and <strong>stowed away</strong> for the <b>entire duration</b> of each class.
        Using such devices in class may lower your participation score. 
        Please do not take photos of the board.<P align="left"> <B>Office:</B> Please feel free to stop by my office whenever you have a question, 
          or if you just want to chat. If my posted hours are inconvenient, I will be 
          happy to schedule an appointment. 
        Tell me if you are having trouble. Catching up can be very difficult once 
          you get behind, so let me know as soon as you think there is a problem. 
          <br>  
          <br>
          <strong>Exercises:</strong> For each section we cover, you should work as many of the exercises as possible for practice. Answers or hints are provided for  odd-numbered exercises. Some of these problems will be used for the tests and final exam.
        
        Keep in mind that there can be many correct approaches for some proof-oriented questions, so the fact that your answer does not match mine does not necessarily mean it is wrong. Ask me if you are ever unsure about the validity of your solution.

        <p><strong>BOILERPLATE INFORMATION:</strong> The following is required on all VCU syllabi: </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Email Policy</strong><br>
            <font size="2">Electronic mail or &quot;email&quot; is considered an official method for communication at VCU because it delivers information in a convenient, timely, cost effective and environmentally aware manner. Students are expected to check their official VCU e-mail on a frequent and consistent basis in order to remain informed of university-related communications. The University recommends checking e-mail daily. Students are responsible for the consequences of not reading, in a timely fashion, university-related communications sent to their official VCU student e-mail account. This policy ensures that all students have access to this important form of communication. It ensures students can be reached through a standardized channel by faculty and other staff of the university as needed. Mail sent to the VCU email address may include notification of university-related actions, including disciplinary action. Please read the policy in its entirety: <a href="http://www.ts.vcu.edu/kb/3407.html">http://www.ts.vcu.edu/kb/3407.html</a></font></li>

          <li><strong>VCU Honor System: Upholding Academic Integrity</strong><br>
            <font size="2">The VCU honor system policy describes the responsibilities of students, faculty and administration in upholding academic integrity, while at the same time respecting the rights of individuals to the due process offered by administrative hearings and appeals. According to this policy, &quot;members of the academic community are required to conduct themselves in accordance with the highest standards of academic honesty and integrity.&quot; Also, &quot;All members of the VCU community are presumed to have an understanding of the VCU Honor System and are required to:<br>
              Agree to be bound by the Honor System policy and its procedures;<br>
              Report suspicion or knowledge of possible violations of the Honor System;<br>
              Support an environment that reflects a commitment to academic integrity;<br>
              Answer truthfully when called upon to do so regarding Honor System cases; and,<br>
              Maintain confidentiality regarding specific information in Honor System cases.&quot;<br>
              The Honor System in its entirety can be reviewed on the Web at <a href="http://www.provost.vcu.edu/pdfs/Honor_system_policy.pdf">http://www.provost.vcu.edu/pdfs/Honor_system_policy.pdf </a>or it can be found in the current issue of the VCU Insider at <a href="http://www.students.vcu.edu/insider.html">http://www.students.vcu.edu/insider.html</a></font><br>

          <li><strong>Student Conduct in the Classroom</strong><br>
            <font size="2">According to the Faculty Guide to Student Conduct in Instructional Settings &quot;The university is a community of learners. Students, as well as faculty, have a responsibility for creating and maintaining an environment that supports effective instruction. In order for faculty members (including graduate teaching assistants) to provide and students to receive effective instruction in classrooms, laboratories, studios, online courses, and other learning areas, the university expects students to conduct themselves in an orderly and cooperative manner.&quot; Among other things, cell phones and beepers should be turned off while in the classroom. Also, the university Rules and Procedures prohibit anyone from having &quot;in his possession any firearm, other weapon, or explosive, regardless of whether a license to possess the same has been issued, without the written authorization of the President of the university...&quot; For more information, visit the VCU Insider online at <a href="http://www.students.vcu.edu/insider.html">http://www.students.vcu.edu/insider.html</a></font></li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Students with Disabilities</strong><br>
            <font size="2">SECTION 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 as amended, require that VCU provides &quot;academic adjustments &quot; or &quot;reasonable accommodations&quot; to any student who has  a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a major life activity.  To receive accommodations, students must request them by contacting the Disability Support Services Office on the Monroe Park Campus (828-2253) or the Division for Academic Success on the MCV campus (828-9782). More information is available at the Disability Support Services webpage: <a href="http://www.students.vcu.edu/dss/">http://www.students.vcu.edu/dss/</a> ; or the Division for Academic Success webpage at <a href="www.specialservices.vcu.edu/disabilityss">www.specialservices.vcu.edu/disabilityss</a>. If you have a disability that requires an academic accommodation, please schedule a meeting with me at your earliest convenience. </font></li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Statement on Military Short-Term Training or Deployment</strong><br>
            <font size="2">If military students receive orders for short-term training or deployment, they should inform and present their orders to Military Student Services and to their professor(s). For further information on policies and procedures contact Military Services at 828-5993 or access the corresponding policies at <a href="http://www.pubapps.vcu.edu/bulletins/about/?Default.aspx?uid=10096&iid=30704">http://www.pubapps.vcu.edu/bulletins/about/?Default.aspx?uid=10096&amp;iid=30704</a> and <a href="http://www.pubapps.vcu.edu/BULLETINS/undergraduate/?uid=10096&iid=30773">http://www.pubapps.vcu.edu/BULLETINS/undergraduate/?uid=10096&amp;iid=30773</a>.</font></li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Excused Absences for Students Representing the University</strong><br>
            <font size="2">Students who represent the university (athletes and others) do not choose their schedules. Student athletes are required to attend games and/or meets. All student athletes should provide their schedule to the instructor at the beginning of the semester. The Intercollegiate Athletic Council (IAC) strongly encourages faculty to treat missed classes or exams (because of a scheduling conflict) as excused absences and urges faculty to work with the students to make up the work or exam.</font></li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Class Registration Required for Attendance</strong><br>
            <font size="2">Please remember that students may only attend those classes for which they have registered. Faculty may not add students to class rosters. Therefore, if students are attending a class for which they have not registered, they must stop attending. </font></li>
