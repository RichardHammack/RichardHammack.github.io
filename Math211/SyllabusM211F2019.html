Topics include sets,              counting, logic, probability, algorithms, methods of proof, and              induction. You are expected to keep up with the reading. There are              frequent written assignments, three tests, and a final exam. Your              grade is determined by scores on assignments, tests, the final              exam, and participation. Details follow. </p>            <dl>              <b>Assignments:</b> Written assignments are collected, graded and              returned. <dd>                <ul>                  <li>Papers are collected at the beginning of class on                    appointed days.</li>                  <li>Papers submitted after the beginning of class may not be                    graded.</li>                  <li>If you can't make it to class, you may email an assignment                    to me, but it must arrive in my inbox no later than the                    beginning of class on the day it is due. I sometimes don't                    print emailed assignments, so you may not get any written                    feedback from me. Please send clear scanned copies in PDF                    format.&nbsp; I cannot guarantee that I can grade other                    formats (no photos from phones, please).

I will drop your lowest test grade. In writing the            tests, I assume that you have been studying the material <em><strong>at
                least 6 hours per week outside of class. </strong></em>No            calculators or other technology will be used on any test or exam.<br>            <br>            <b>Participation/Engagement:</b> Participation means that you in            some way demonstrate intellectual involvement in the course. It does            not necessarily mean that you ask questions and volunteer answers.            Active participation may include your working lots of exercises,            taking advantage of office hours, and displaying preparedness,            dedication and intellectual curiosity. Things that could cause you            to lose participation points include sleeping in class, using your            phone in class, texting in class, missing too much class, etc.<br>            <br>            <b>Final Exam:</b> The final exam is comprehensive, covering all            material discussed in class. It is closed-book and closed-notes.            Section 003 takes the exam 12:30–3:20 pm on Thursday December 12;            Section 001 takes it 8:00–10:50 am on Tuesday December 17. In            writing the final exam, I will assume that you have been studying            the material <em><strong>at least 6 hours per week outside of                class, throughout the entire semester. </strong></em> <br>            <br>            <table width="100%" cellpadding="3" border="0">              <tbody>                <tr valign="top">                  <td><b>Grading:</b> </td>                  <td align="RIGHT">                    <div align="center"><strong>The 10-point grading scale is                        used:<br>                      </strong> <br>                      <table width="35%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0">                        <tbody>                          <tr>                            <td align="LEFT">A:</td>                            <td align="RIGHT"> 90<i>–</i>100</td>                          </tr>                          <tr>                            <td align="LEFT">B:</td>                            <td align="RIGHT">80<i>–</i>89</td>                          </tr>                          <tr>                            <td align="LEFT">C:</td>                            <td align="RIGHT">70<i>–</i>79</td>                          </tr>                          <tr>                            <td align="LEFT">D:</td>                            <td align="RIGHT">60<i>–</i>69</td>                          </tr>                          <tr>                            <td align="LEFT">F:</td>                            <td align="RIGHT">0<i>–</i>59</td>                          </tr>                        </tbody>                      </table>                    </div>                  </td>                  <td align="RIGHT">                    <div align="center"><strong>Your final average will be                        computed as follows:</strong> <br>                      <table width="50%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0">                        <tbody>                          <tr>                            <td width="76%" align="LEFT">Assignments:</td>                            <td width="24%" align="RIGHT">20%</td>                          </tr>                          <tr>                            <td align="LEFT">Highest Two Test Grades: </td>                            <td align="RIGHT">45%</td>                          </tr>                          <tr>                            <td align="LEFT">Participation:</td>                            <td align="RIGHT">3%</td>                          </tr>                          <tr>                            <td align="LEFT">Final Exam:</td>                            <td align="RIGHT">32%</td>                          </tr>                          <tr>                            <td colspan="2" align="LEFT">                              <hr></td>                          </tr>                          <tr>                            <td align="LEFT">Total: </td>                            <td align="RIGHT">100%</td>                          </tr>                        </tbody>                      </table>                    </div>                  </td>                </tr>              </tbody>            </table>            <strong><br>            </strong></td>        </tr>      </tbody>    </table>    <table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0">      <tbody>        <tr>          <td width="5%">&nbsp;</td>          <td width="95%">            <p><b>Attendance: </b>I do not take attendance, but I do notice if              you are not attending class. If your grades are high, I do not              mind if you miss class occasionally; otherwise, excessive absences              may result in a reduced participation score. You are responsible              for all material covered in class. As a matter of courtesy, you              should arrive punctually and stay for the entire duration of each              class you attend.

Otherwise, one missed test will count as your dropped lowest              test grade. I will drop several low homework grades. If you miss a              homework assignment, then that counts as a dropped grade (up to              the number of assignments dropped). If you miss the final exam for              a legitimate reason (i.e. a documented illness or emergency) then              I can give you a grade of Incomplete (I) for the course, and you              will need to make up the missed exam.<b><br>                <br>                Internet:</b> Information about this course is posted on my web              page (not on Blackboard).

Tell me if you are having trouble. Catching up can              be very difficult once you get behind, so let me know as soon as              you think there is a problem. <br>              <br>              <strong>Exercises:</strong> For each section we cover, you should              work as many of the exercises as possible for practice. Answers or              hints are provided for odd-numbered exercises. Some of these              problems will be used for the tests and final exam. Keep in mind              that there can be many correct approaches for some proof-oriented              questions, so the fact that your answer does not match mine does              not necessarily mean it is wrong.

Students are expected to check                  their official VCU e-mail on a frequent and consistent basis                  in order to remain informed of university-related                  communications. The University recommends checking e-mail                  daily.
