An introduction to mathematical logic and set            theory, including applications in Boolean algebras and graph theory.<b><br>              <br>              Prerequisites:</b> Calculus-level placement on the VCU Mathematics            Placement Test within the one-year period immediately preceding            enrollment in the course or MATH 151, MATH 200, MATH 201 or BUSN 212            with a minimum grade of C. <br>            <br>            This class is an introduction to methods of <em>discrete</em>            mathematical structures and systems. Topics include sets, counting,            logic, probability, algorithms, methods of proof, and induction.            This involves the first 14 chapters of the textbook. You are            expected to keep up with the reading and work practice exercises.            There are frequent quizzes, three tests, and a final exam. Your            grade is determined by scores on assignments, tests, the final exam,            and participation.<br>            <br>            <b>Text:</b> <em>Discrete Math Elements, </em> by Richard Hammack.            Free PDF download at the course web page: <tt><a href="index.html">www.people.vcu.edu/~rhammack/Math211</a></tt>            <br>            <dl>              <b>Homework:</b> On the course calendar you will find suggested              odd-numbered exercises. You should work as many of these as it              takes to cement the ideas. Solutions for odd-numbered exercises              can be found at the end of each chapter. Some class time will be              reserved to discuss exercises.<br>              <br>              <b>Quizzes: </b>Frequent short quizzes will be given. Quiz              problems will be similar (often identical) to the suggested              odd-numbered exercises. <br>              <dd>                <ul>                </ul>              </dd>            </dl>            <strong>Tests:</strong> There are three tests (dates to be            determined). I will drop your lowest test grade. In writing the            tests, I assume that you have been studying the material <em><strong>at
                least 6 hours per week outside of class. </strong></em>No            calculators or other technology will be used on any test or exam.<br>            <br>            <b>Participation/Engagement:</b> Participation means that you in            some way demonstrate intellectual involvement in the course. It does            not necessarily mean that you ask questions and volunteer answers.            Active participation may include your working lots of exercises and            displaying preparedness, dedication and intellectual curiosity.            Things that could cause you to lose participation points include            sleeping in class, using your phone in class, texting in class,            missing too much class, etc.<br>            <br>            <b>Final Exam:</b> The final exam is comprehensive, covering all            material discussed in class. The date can be found on the course            calendar. In writing the final exam, I will assume that you have            been studying the material <em><strong>at least 6 hours per week                outside of class, throughout the entire semester. </strong></em>            <br>            <br>            <table width="100%" cellpadding="3" border="0">              <tbody>                <tr valign="top">                  <td><b>Grading:</b> </td>                  <td align="RIGHT">                    <div align="center"><strong>The 10-point grading scale is                        used:<br>                      </strong> <br>                      <table width="35%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0">                        <tbody>                          <tr>                            <td align="LEFT">A:</td>                            <td align="RIGHT"> 90<i>–</i>100</td>                          </tr>                          <tr>                            <td align="LEFT">B:</td>                            <td align="RIGHT">80<i>–</i>89</td>                          </tr>                          <tr>                            <td align="LEFT">C:</td>                            <td align="RIGHT">70<i>–</i>79</td>                          </tr>                          <tr>                            <td align="LEFT">D:</td>                            <td align="RIGHT">60<i>–</i>69</td>                          </tr>                          <tr>                            <td align="LEFT">F:</td>                            <td align="RIGHT">0<i>–</i>59</td>                          </tr>                        </tbody>                      </table>                    </div>                  </td>                  <td align="RIGHT">                    <div align="center"><strong>Your final average will be                        computed as follows:</strong> <br>                      <table width="65%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0">                        <tbody>                          <tr>                            <td width="76%" align="LEFT">Quizzes:</td>                            <td width="24%" align="RIGHT">20%</td>                          </tr>                          <tr>                            <td align="LEFT">Highest two test grades: </td>                            <td align="RIGHT">45%</td>                          </tr>                          <tr>                            <td align="LEFT">Participation:</td>                            <td align="RIGHT">3%</td>                          </tr>                          <tr>                            <td align="LEFT">Final Exam:</td>                            <td align="RIGHT">32%</td>                          </tr>                          <tr>                            <td colspan="2" align="LEFT">                              <hr></td>                          </tr>                          <tr>                            <td align="LEFT">Total: </td>                            <td align="RIGHT">100%</td>                          </tr>                        </tbody>                      </table>                    </div>                  </td>                </tr>              </tbody>            </table>            <strong><br>              Extra Credit: </strong>For every typo or mistake you find in the            textbook, I will give you one extra quiz point.&nbsp; Please email            me any corrections on<strong> Fridays. </strong>I will then update            the textbook based on your feedback and re-post it.<strong> </strong>To
