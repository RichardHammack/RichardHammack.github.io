I see this work as being closely aligned              with printmaking, with the postmarked stamp a stand-in for an              edition number. The envelopes are the subject of a short paper              (which you can find <a href="reprints/bridges2022-277.pdf">here</a>)              in the proceedings of <a href="https://www.bridgesmathart.org">Bridges
                2022</a> at Aalto University, Finland.

This creates three holes, bounded by the            red, green and blue contours, respectively. Note that the red/green            strip passes through the blue hole, the green/blue strip passes            through the red hole, and the blue/red strip passes through the            green hole. This is a flat variant of Boy's surface, and immersion            of the projective plane in 3D space without pinchpoints. Indeed,            widen the three strips and the three holes narrow into three slits            through which the surface passes through itself.<br>            <br>            <br>          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td>            <div align="center"><a href="graphics/KleinBottleEnv2.jpg"><img src="graphics/KleinBottleEnv2.jpg"                  height="300"                  width="760"                  border="0"><br>                <span style="color: black;"></span></a><i><b>Klein Bottle (with                  one holes)</b></i>, PDF-LaTeX, paper, glue, 2022. <br>              <br>            </div>            This envelope is a sphere with two cross-caps (with a hole).
