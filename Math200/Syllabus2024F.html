                    two-semester sequence covering the calculus of one-variable
                    functions. This course covers the fundamental ideas of
                    differential and integral calculus: Limits, continuity,
                    derivatives, differentials, antiderivatives and definite
                    integrals. We also examine some ways that these ideas apply
                    to real-world problems. <b>Learning Outcomes:</b> The
                    course is designed to give you the mathematical background
                    necessary for many courses in the natural and social
                    sciences, as well as to provide a foundation for further

                  <td width="96%"> <strong></strong>You can do well in calculus
                    if you study and practice daily. Many ideas in calculus can
                    take some time to sink in; you will not learn them
                    instantaneously.&nbsp; The key is to take a few small steps
                    each day. (Attempting big steps only once per week---or
                    worse, only before a test---is a recipe for failure.)&nbsp;
                    Here are some tips for this course:<br>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Consult the Course Calendar often. See what chapters
                        are referenced and watch the corresponding video
                        lecture(s) prior to that date. (The video lectures have
                        the same numbering as the course notes chapters. For
                        example, Lecture 4 is for Chapter 4, etc.) Watch the
                        lectures <i>actively</i>. Consider pausing the video to
                        work examples before the solution is shown.</li>
                      <li>Read the course notes or text actively with pencil
                        &amp; paper, checking details.</li>
                      <li>Consult the Exercise List and work the indicated
                        exercises in the course notes until you obtain fluency.
                        Answers to odd-numbered exercises are at the end of each
                        chapter.</li>
                      <li>Though class attendance is not always required, it is
                        strongly encouraged. In missing a class you may also
                        miss valuable insights, practice and experience. Miss
                        class at your own risk.</li>
                      <li>Depending on your learning style, working in study
                        groups can be helpful. However, be ready to do the
                        quizzes and exams on your own!</li>
                      <li>Let me know if you have any questions. </li>
