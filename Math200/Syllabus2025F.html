                    two-semester sequence covering the calculus of one-variable
                    functions. This course covers the fundamental ideas of
                    differential and integral calculus: Limits, continuity,
                    derivatives, differentials, antiderivatives and definite
                    integrals. We also examine some ways that these ideas apply
                    to real-world problems. <b>Learning Outcomes:</b> The
                    course is designed to give you the mathematical background
                    necessary for many courses in the natural and social
                    sciences, as well as to provide a foundation for further
                    study in mathematics.<br>

                    if you study and practice daily. Many ideas in calculus can
                    take some time to sink in; you will not learn them
                    instantaneously.&nbsp; The key is to take a few small steps
                    each day. (Attempting big steps only once per week---or
                    worse, only before a test---is a recipe for failure.)&nbsp;
                    Here are some tips for this course:<br>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Consult the Course Calendar often. See what chapters
                        are referenced and watch the corresponding video
                        lecture(s) prior to that date. Watch the
                        lectures <i>actively</i>. Consider pausing the video to
                        work examples before the solution is shown.</li>
                      <li>Read the text actively with pencil
                        &amp; paper, checking details.</li>
                      <li>Consult the Exercise List and work the indicated
                        exercises in the text until you obtain fluency.
                        Answers to odd-numbered exercises are at the end of each
                        chapter.</li>
                      <li>Though class attendance is not always required, it is
                        strongly encouraged. In missing a class you may also
                        miss valuable insights, practice and experience. Miss
                        class at your own risk.</li>
                      <li>Depending on your learning style, working in study
                        groups can be helpful. However, be ready to do the
                        quizzes and tests on your own!</li>
                      <li>Let me know if you have any questions. </li>
