        <B>Text:</B> <EM>A First Course in Abstract Algebra, </EM>by John Fraleigh, 
  Seventh edition
        <br>
        <br>
        <i>Abstract Algebra</i> deals with the <em>structure </em>of algebraic systems. The familiar algebraic operations on numbers 
          are distilled into mathematical entities called groups, rings and fields. 
          This greatly widens the scope, utility and generality of algebra, for the things that get added or multiplied 
          in these structures are not necessarily numbers. This course is designed 
          to expose you to some key algebraic ideas used in advanced mathematics, as well 
          as to sharpen your abstract reasoning and theorem-proving skills.<br>
          <br>
        Although abstract algebra has many applications, our approach is primarily 
        theoretical. You will write lots of proofs. You may have to think about things 
        in new and challenging ways. This can require lots of time, hard work, deep thought 
        and imagination.<br>
        <br>
        Material from Chapters 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 is covered.<br>
     Your grade is determined 
        by homework assignments, two tests (one in-class and one take-home) and a final exam. Details follow.<br>
          <br>
          <B>Homework:</B> Frequent homework assignments are collected, graded and returned. 
        <ul>
  <li> Papers are collected at the beginning of class on appointed days.
   <li>I usually do not grade late homework.
  <li>Messy or illegible work may not be graded.
  <li>I am attentive to how well you communicate your ideas. Points may be deducted 
    for bad style.
 
  <li> I encourage you to work together on homework, though the work you turn 
    in must be your own.<br>
    <li> Three or more of your lowest homework grades are dropped.
    <li>In addition to the work you hand in, you should work <em>lots</em> of extra 
      problems for practice. <br>Many odd-numbered problems have answers or hints in the back 
      of the text.<br>
    <li><strong><em>Some homework problems are intended to make you think about ideas not discussed 
      in class.</em></strong>
        </ul>
<B><br>
Tests:</B> There are two tests and a final exam, tentatively scheduled as follows:

          <P> <B>Make-up Tests:</B> A make-up test can be scheduled if you miss a test due to an illness or emergency. To arrange a make-up, you must contact me on or before the date of the test. <br>
              <br>
              
              <B>Attendance: </B>I do not take attendance, but I do notice if you are not 
            attending class.
            As a matter of courtesy, you should arrive punctually and stay for the entire 
            duration of each class you attend.
          <P><b>Cell Phones:</b> Please be sure that all cell phones and similar devices 
            are turned<b> off </b>for the <b>entire duration</b> of each class. 
          <P><b>Internet:</b> Information about this course is posted on the Internet. To 
            find it, go to my home page <tt>(http://www.people.vcu.edu/~rhammack/</tt>) and click on &quot;Math 
            501.&quot; There you will find the syllabus, homework assignments, a calendar, 
            copies of old tests, and grades, among other resources. 
          <P> <B>Office:</B> Please feel free to stop by my office whenever you have a question, 
            or if you just want to chat. If my posted hours are inconvenient, I will be 
            happy to schedule an appointment. 
            Tell me if you are having trouble. Catching up can be very difficult once 
            you get behind, so let me know as soon as you think there is a problem. <br>
    <br>
            Any student eligible for and needing academic adjustments or accommodations because of a disability should contact me within the first week of class.
