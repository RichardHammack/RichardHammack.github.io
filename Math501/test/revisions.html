      pages. I will read them and ask you to further revise any solution or proof 
      that is not exactly right. I will not give extra credit on the test until 
      each problem is exactly right. I will not accept a proof that does not contain 
      complete and meaningful sentences.<br>

      you will probably want to make modifications to a file instead of completely 
      rewriting the solution. Mathematica (in text mode) is capable of displaying 
      all of the symbols we use in this class.<br>
