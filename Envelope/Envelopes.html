Well-known examples include spheres, Klein            bottles, and tori. This page describes my recent project of            designing mailing envelopes that are closed surfaces. The envelopes            are the subject of two short papers: most recently in MAA FOCUS, <a              href="../reprints/MAA_FOCUS_2013.pdf">here</a>,            and also in the proceedings of <a href="https://www.bridgesmathart.org">Bridges
              2022</a> at Aalto University, Finland, <a href="reprints/bridges2022-277.pdf">here</a>.            The YouTube video of my conference presentation (about 8 minutes) is            <a href="https://youtu.be/XmmyljX4094">here</a>. These artworks were            exhibited at Bridges 2022 (Helsinki, Finland) and at the 2023 Joint            Mathematics Meetings (Boston, MA). In Boston they won the prize for            Best Photograph/Painting/Print. They are also included in the group            show <em>Seeing the Unseen: Math and Art</em>, in the Wignall            Museum of Contemporary Art at Chaffey College (Jan 8-March 9, 2024).<br>            <hr>            <p class="MsoNormal"><b><br>              </b></p>            <p class="MsoNormal"><b>The mail arrives</b>. Pick up a letter, and              behold a topological curiosity. The envelope divides space into              two regions: You are outside, and a letter is inside. The envelope              is a sphere! Another envelope contains a bill. It has a window              that reveals your address, which is printed on the bill. The              envelope is a sphere with a disk removed!<o:p></o:p></p>          </td>        </tr>        <tr>          <td>            <div align="center"><a href="EnvSphere.jpg"><img src="EnvSphere.jpg"                  width="393"                  border="0"                  height="205"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;

Here is a portfolio of the            envelopes that I created. Each is a topologically accurate (but            flat) realization of a surface (such as a Klein bottle, torus,            projective plane, etc.). <o:p></o:p> <br>            <p class="MsoNormal">One of my first constructions was a Klein              bottle (Figure 2) having the form of a flat tube with a window,              folded so that one end of the tube passes through the window and              glues to the other end. There is no need to open this envelope,              because it has no interior! I use it like a postcard, with a              message on the back.<o:p></o:p></p>            <p class="MsoNormal">Like all of my envelopes, the Klein bottles              begins life as a LaTeX file that is typeset, printed, cut, folded              and glued. But it’s not really finished until it’s mailed to a              friend or colleague. I see my envelopes as being closely aligned              with printmaking, with the return address and postmarked stamp              standing in for a signature and edition number.<o:p></o:p></p>            <br>            <br>            <div align="center"><a href="Klein.jpg"><img src="Klein.jpg" width="500"                  border="0"                  height="286"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;

The first is a projective              plane (with a hole). The second is another realization of a Klein              bottle (with a hole). Each strip is a portion of a Mobius band              that gives passage from the “outside” of the envelope to the              “inside.” In theory, one could add <i>n </i>strips in sequence              around the window, resulting in a sphere with<i> n</i> cross-caps              (and one hole). By the classification theorem for compact              surfaces, it’s therefore possible to make a one-holed envelope              that is any non-orientable, connected, compact surface we desire!<o:p></o:p></p>            <br>            <br>            <div align="center"><a href="EnvProj.jpg"><img src="EnvProj.jpg" width="393"                  border="0"                  height="205"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;

It has three holes, bounded by red,              green and blue lines. But it is <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">not</i>              a sphere with three cross-caps, as the reader can verify by              computing its Euler characteristic (after mentally capping the              three holes with hexagons). The Euler characteristic is -1, so the              envelope is a projective plane. It is, in fact, a flat variant of              Boy’s surface. Werner Boy discovered this fascinating surface in              1901 when his dissertation advisor David Hilbert asked him to              prove that the projective plane cannot be immersed in              three-dimensional space. Instead, Boy proved the opposite by              producing a beautiful immersion with 3-fold symmetry. </p>            <br>            <div align="center"><a href="Boy.jpg"><img src="Boy.jpg" width="600"                  border="0"                  height="316"><br>              </a><strong><br>                Figure 4.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Boy's surface (with three              holes). If the bands were widened, the three holes would narrow              into three slits through which the paper passes through itself.<br>            </div>            <br>            <p> Not all of my envelopes are non-orientable.

It has              a transparent plastic window so that the viewer can peek in and              better comprehend its structure.</p>            <br>            <br>            <div align="center"><a href="Torus.jpg"><img src="Torus.jpg" width="500"                  border="0"                  height="286"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
